AI for Learning

How do you think the increasing availability and quality of AI chat and large learning models will affect the software industry in the near future?
I think there will be many poorly designed, and or unethically designed AI chatbots / LLMs. At the same time, people will continue to develop LLMs that are more robust and better suited for intrusion detection and prevention. I use two chatbots for information currently. I used Bard for instance when I want an advanced Google search that will return a fair amount of information. What I like about Bard is that at times the information it returns also has a link at the bottom of the returned information, that link provides where Bard pulled the information from, this is important to me when I am researching and I need a source for my information.
The other Chatbot I use is OpenAi’s ChatGPT. I like ChatGTP for many reasons: For instance, I started a new chat regarding only my cyber security queries, and or other school course-specific questions, what I found is the longer you have the conversation thread going the performance is reduced, it becomes slightly laggy when you navigate through the thread. Once you enter your next question the program freezes until the data starts printing, and then while printing it may print in chunks. This sometimes causes a network error, or it times out. 
The interesting thing about ChatGTP regarding keeping my school course-specific questions thread open is that you can have it consider your past conversations and questions to possibly help you articulate your overall thoughts and concepts of your school course-specific topics.
Overall, I welcome ethically based, secure, and robust AI technologies. I look at it as the more proficient I become in reading code and understanding the function of these codes, in combination with AI technology will expedite my learning goals.


What philosophy or guidelines can you adopt to make your learning effort on the right level of engagement for a flow state, engagement between boredom and overwhelm?

Discipline, adaptability, and resilience are what help me create an engaging work flow-state. As once an active-duty soldier, I was always on the move, always busy. This mirrors the idea of being constantly engaged, and I like to think I transferred this to coding, where there is an infinite sea of knowledge and tasks. 
In the military, one is trained to take on challenges head-on but also to recognize when a tactical retreat or change of strategy is necessary. Similarly, in coding and learning, there is an understanding that sometimes you hit a wall. Instead of pushing yourself to the point of extreme frustration, it is more productive to take a step back, rest, and approach the problem later with a fresh perspective.
What I like about coding the most is there is always something new to learn or a different perspective to consider. I guess I could say my approach to challenges is being persistent, but also knowing when to take a break—is key to achieving a state of flow. In both the military and coding realms, this state of optimal focus is crucial. It is not just about pushing forward but recognizing the importance of balance, recovery, and strategic thinking.
